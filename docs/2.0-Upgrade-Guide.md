# Updating to 2.0

## Breaking Changes

### New Package Names

The `Centeva.ObjectStorage.S3`package has been renamed to
`Centeva.ObjectStorage.AWS` to be consistent with the other packages.  You will
need to manually replace the package in your .csproj files, or uninstall the
old one and install the new one using the package manager.

### Connection Strings

When using connection strings to specify a cloud storage location, the provider
names have been changed to use a `provider.product` syntax:

* `s3` -> `aws.s3`
* `azure` -> `azure.blob`
* `google` -> `google.storage`

The old syntax will continue to work, but will be removed in a future release.

### Provider Registration

The `StorageFactory` provider registration methods have been updated for
consistency:

```csharp
var factory = new StorageFactory()
    .UseGoogleCloudStorage()
    .UseAwsS3Storage()
    .UseAzureBlobStorage();
```

The `UseS3CompatibleStorage()` method will still work but is marked as obsolete
and will be removed in a future release.

## New Features

### Local Disk Provider

The `DiskObjectStorage` provider is now available from the main
`Centeva.ObjectStorage` package.  You can manually create an instance of this:

```csharp
IObjectStorage storage = new DiskObjectStorage("/path/to/storage");
```

Or you can use the connection string method of creating an instance:

```csharp
var factory = new StorageFactory();

var storage = factory.GetConnection('disk://path=/path/to/storage');
```

### Target .NET Versions

Packages are now built with both .NET 6 and .NET 8 targets.

### SourceLink

SourceLink is now enabled for all packages.  This allows you to step into the
source code when debugging.

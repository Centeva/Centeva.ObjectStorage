# Updating to 2.0

## Breaking Changes

### New Package Names

The `Centeva.ObjectStorage.S3`package has been renamed to
`Centeva.ObjectStorage.AWS` to be consistent with the other packages.  Remove
any `Centeva.ObjectStorage.S3` package references from your projects and replace
them with `Centeva.ObjectStorage.AWS`.

### Connection Strings

When using connection strings to specify a cloud storage location, the provider
names have been changed to use a `provider.product` syntax:

* `s3` -> `aws.s3`
* `azure` -> `azure.blob`
* `google` -> `google.storage`

The old syntax will continue to work, but will be removed in a future release.

### Provider Registration

The `StorageFactory` provider registration methods have been updated for
consistency.  Replace them in your existing code with the following, adjusted to
include only the providers you need:

```csharp
var factory = new StorageFactory()
    .UseGoogleCloudStorage()
    .UseAwsS3Storage()
    .UseAzureBlobStorage();
```

The `UseS3CompatibleStorage()` method will still work but is marked as obsolete
and will be removed in a future release.

### ListAsync returns `IReadOnlyCollection`

The `ListAsync` method now returns `IReadOnlyCollection<string>` instead of
`IEnumerable<string>`.  This provides the `Count` property and indicates to the
caller that the collection is complete (no lazy evaluation when iterating) and
read-only.  This should only be a breaking change if you are explicitly
depending on the return type being `IEnumerable<string>`, since
`IReadOnlyCollection<string>` is a superset of `IEnumerable<string>`.

## New Features

### Local Disk Provider

The `DiskObjectStorage` provider is now available from the main
`Centeva.ObjectStorage` package.  You can manually create an instance of this:

```csharp
IObjectStorage storage = new DiskObjectStorage("/path/to/storage");
```

Or you can use the connection string method of creating an instance:

```csharp
var factory = new StorageFactory();

var storage = factory.GetConnection('disk://path=/path/to/storage');
```

### .NET 8 Target

Packages are now built with both .NET 6 and .NET 8 targets.

### SourceLink

SourceLink is now enabled for all packages.  This allows you to step into the
source code when debugging.
